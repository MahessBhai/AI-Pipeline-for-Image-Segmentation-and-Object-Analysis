# AI-Pipeline-for-Image-Segmentation-and-Object-Analysis

## Overview

This project provides a pipeline for image segmentation and object analysis using advanced models. It includes a Streamlit application for a user-friendly interface where users can upload images or directories of images to be processed. The pipeline uses the SAM model for segmentation, ResNet for object identification, EasyOCR for text extraction, Summarize Object Attributes using predefined dictionaries, and Data Mapping output in a single json file. The results include segmented images, segmented objects, and metadata.
